      y Usage Notes: Replace with the actual path to the profile picture. You
      can customize the UserProfile component further as needed. Ensure the
      components such as Users, Invoices, CreateCourse, etc., are correctly
      imported and exist within your project. With this setup, you can display a
      short profile in the sidebar, providing essential information such as
      name, email, avatar, and role. The sidebar also allows toggling components
      without page redirection.
